## Additional Information
- This backup script assumes that you are using the itzg/minecraft-server docker image.
- Volumes should be mounted for:
    - `/app/server` for the minecraft server
    - `/app/backups` to access the backups
    - `/app/logs` to access logs generated by the backup script.
    - an additional volume, `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` should be mounted so this container can manage the minecraft server.
- A Cron job runs the backup every day at 11:59 pm, currently there is no way to configure it at this time.
